\subsection{General validity}
\label{subsec:general}
Check against the following checklist:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!5!white,colframe=black!75!white,title=Checklist for Case Design from \cite{runeson2009guidelines}]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What is the case nad its units of analysis?
      \item Are clear objectives, preliminary research questions, hypotheses (if any) defined in advance?
      \item Is the theoretical basis- relation to existing literature or other cases -defined?
      \item Are the authors intentions with the research made clear?
      \item Is the case adequately defined (size, domain, process, subjects, etc.)?
      \item Is a cause-effect relation under study? If yes, is it possible to distinguish the cause from other factos using the proposed design?
      \item Does the design invovle data from multiple sources (data triangulation), using multiple methods (method triangulation)?
      \item Is there a rationale behind the selection of subjects, roles, artifacts, viewpoints, etc.?
      \item Is the specified case relevant to validity address the research questions (construct validity)?
      \item Is the integrity og individual/organizations taken into account?
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Construct validity}
\label{subsec:construct}
Show that the correct operational meausures are planned for the concepts in the study. Some tactics to consider: multiple source of evidence, establish chains of evidence, expert reviews. 

\subsection{External validity}
\label{subsec:external}
Identify the domain to which study is relevant. Use multiple-case studies to investigate outcomes in different contexts.
