\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!5!white,colframe=black!75!white,title=Checklist for Preparation for data collection \cite{runeson2009guidelines}]
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{10}
    \item Is a case study protocol for data collection and analysis derived (what, why,
    how, when)? Are procedures for its update defined?
    \item Are multiple data sources and collection methods planned (triangulation)?
    \item Are measurement instruments and procedures well defined (measurement definitions, interview questions)?
    \item Are the planned methods and measurements sufficient to fulfill the objective of the study?
    \item Is the study design approved by a review board, and has informed consent obtained from individuals and organizations?
    \item Is data collected according to the case study protocol?
    \item Is the observed phenomenon correctly implemented (e.g., to what extent is a design method under study actually used)?
    \item Is data recorded to enable further analysis?
    \item Are sensitive results identified (for individuals, the organization or the project)?
    \item Are the data collection procedures well traceable?
    \item Does the collected data provide ability to address the research question?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Checklist for analysis of collected data}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!5!white,colframe=black!75!white,title=Checklist for Preparation for data collection \cite{runeson2009guidelines}]
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{21}
    \item Is the analysis methodology defined, including roles and review procedures?
    \item Is a chain of evidence shown with traceable inferences from data to research
    questions and existing theory?
    \item Are alternative perspectives and explanations used in the analysis?
    \item Is a causeâ€“effect relation under study? If yes, is it possible to distinguish the
    cause from other factors in the analysis?
    \item Are there clear conclusions from the analysis, including recommendations for
    practice/further research?
    \item Are threats to the validity analyzed in a systematic way and countermeasures
    taken? (Construct, internal, external, reliability)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Checklist for reporting case studies}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!5!white,colframe=black!75!white,title=Checklist for Preparation for data collection \cite{runeson2009guidelines}]
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{27}
    \item  Are the case and its units of analysis adequately presented?
    \item  Are the objective, the research questions and corresponding answers reported?
    \item  Are related theory and hypotheses clearly reported?
    \item Are the data collection procedures presented, with relevant motivation?
    \item Is sufficient raw data presented (e.g., real-life examples, quotations)?
    \item Are the analysis procedures clearly reported?
    \item Are threats to validity analyses reported along with countermeasures taken to reduce threats?
    \item Are ethical issues reported openly (personal intentions, integrity issues, confidentiality)
    \item Does the report contain conclusions, implications for practice, and future research?
    \item Does the report give a realistic and credible impression?
    \item Is the report suitable for its audience, easy to read, and well structured?
