# template-casestudy-SE

Case study research is a well-established technique for investigating different phenomena in software engineering. This template aims to provide a squeleton for designing a Case Study. 
The template is mainly based on two resources:

- Runeson, P., & HÃ¶st, M. (2009). Guidelines for conducting and reporting case study research in software engineering. Empirical software engineering, 14(2), 131-164.
- Runeson, P., Host, M., Rainer, A., & Regnell, B. (2012). Case study research in software engineering: Guidelines and examples. John Wiley & Sons. 

I am preparing this template since every time I was planning a new study, I felt like starting from scratch and lacking a template to start adding content to design the study. Although there are checklist of aspects to consider in case study research, I have not seen a template to start designing a case study. Additionally, I also provide some hints and pointers to helpful resources.
